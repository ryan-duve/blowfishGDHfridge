 * Description:
 *
 * Having a simulation with every physics process would be nice,
 * but is not feasable.  This file controls what physics processes
 * and particles are included in the simulations.  Since this
 * simullation is concerned with neutrons, there will be
 * neutrons processes ontop of the usual EM processes.
 * This physics list is based on LHEP_PRECO_HP
 *
 * Credits:
 * 
 * Much of this code is from my supervisor, Dr. Pywell and the
 * examples produced by the Geant4 Collaboration and distributed
 * with GEANT4.  Lisence details for the GEANT4 collaboration code
 * can be found at http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/license/
 * Since these details are vague, I assume that all code is released
 * under an LGPL or BSD-like license.
