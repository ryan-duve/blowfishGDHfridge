 * Description:
 *
 * This class defines the initial particles and its energy, momentum
 * and direction.  Simulates a Th-232 source, such as the background
 * radiation found in the gamma vault at HIGS.

 * Credits:

 * Much of this code is from my supervisor, Dr. Pywell and the
 * examples produced by the Geant4 Collaboration and distributed
 * with GEANT4.  Lisence details for the GEANT4 collaboration code
