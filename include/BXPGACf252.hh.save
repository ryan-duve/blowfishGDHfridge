 * Description:
 *
 * This class defines the initial particles and its energy, momentum
 * and direction.  Emits Cf-252 gamma rays and neutrons from spontaneous
 * fission.  Does not emmit alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays
 * that originate from alpha decay.  Also does not emit fission
 * fragments.

 * Much of this code is from my supervisor, Dr. Pywell and the
 * examples produced by the Geant4 Collaboration and distributed
 * with GEANT4.  Lisence details for the GEANT4 collaboration code
