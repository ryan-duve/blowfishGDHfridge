 * Description:
 *
 * This class defines the initial particles and its energy, momentum
 * and direction.  Emits AmBe gamma rays and neutrons.
 * Does not emmit alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays
 * other than the 4.44 MeV line.  Gamma rays from neutron capture are
 * not produced as these are dependent on geometry.
 *
 * Credits:

 * Much of this code is from my supervisor, Dr. Pywell and the
 * examples produced by the Geant4 Collaboration and distributed
 * with GEANT4.  Lisence details for the GEANT4 collaboration code
 * can be found at http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/license/
