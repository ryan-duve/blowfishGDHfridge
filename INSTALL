blowfishGDHFridge
=================

Geant4 simulation of blowfish in the DGH configuration
with the Fridge/Target

This version assumes Lucid is installed on your computer
since it needs Lucid libraries to write an output file
in the same format as from the data acquisition system.

Installation instructions.
-------------------------

1. Geant4
=========
These instructions assume a recent version of Geant4 is installed.
Currenty I use geant4.10.00.p03

At http://nucleus.usask.ca/ftp/pub/rob/
the file GEANT4_INSTALL provides a description of how we install
geant4 on our computers at the U of Saskatchewan.

In the following we will suppose you have installed geant4
in a directory structure such as
/home/user/geant4
        /geant4-source
        /geant4-install
        /geant4-build
If your structure is different you will need to modify accordingly.

2. G4Lucid
==========
Obtain the file "G4Lucid-1.1.tgz" from http://nucleus.usask.ca/ftp/pub/rob
Unpack the tar file in "/home/user/geant4"
Follow the installation instructions found in
/home/user/geant4/G4Lucid-1.1/README

3. LightOutput
==============
Obtain the file "LightOutput-1.2.tgz" from http://nucleus.usask.ca/ftp/pub/rob
Unpack the tar file in "/home/user/geant4"
Follow the installation instructions found in
/home/user/geant4/LightOutput-1.2/README

4. blowfishGDHFridge
====================

Obtain the file "blowfishGDHFridge-1.0.tgz" from http://nucleus.usask.ca/ftp/pub/rob/
Unpack the tar file in "/home/user/geant4"

e.g. suppose you have installed geant4 in a directory structure
/home/user/geant4
        /geant4-source
        /geant4-install
        /geant4-build
then
        cd /home/user/geant4
and type
        tar  zxvf blowfishGHDFridge-1.0.tgz
this will create the directory "BlowfishGDHFridge-1.0"

Set the environment variables as they would be for compiling
a geant4 simulation:
        e.g. by cd /home/user/geant4/geant4-install/bin),
        then source geant4-config
then
        cd /home/user/geant4/blowfishGDHFridge-1.0

Building the application.
-------------------------
Using the CMake GUI is easiest so this will be described
but you can also use the command line.
Start the GUI
	Browse Source and set it to /home/user/geant4/blowfishGDHFridge-1.0
	Browse Build and set it to /home/user/geant4/blowfishGDHFridge-1.0
	Click Configure
Choose the default "Unix Makefiles" and "Use Native Compilers"
in the popup and click OK.
If an error pop-up appears, click OK in it.

It will complain that it cannot find the package configuration file for Geant4.
Set "Geant4_DIR" by
	clicking on Geant4_DIR-NOTFOUND then clicking on the [...] button
	Choose the geant4 directory containing the "Geant4Config.cmake" file
	e.g. /home/user/geant4/geant4-install/lib/Geant4-9.6.1
	click "Open"
click Configure again

G4Lucid_lib, LightOutput_lib, and Lucid_lib will be highlighted in red.
Normally these libraries will be found automatically so the correct
paths for these should be filled in correctly. If your directory structure
is different you may have to set these by hand by clicking on them an then
clicking on the [...] button.

Just clicking Configure again will make the red highlights go away.

It should simply report "Configuring done".
	(You do not need to change CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE or CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
	The blowfish application can stay in this directory.)
click Generate
It should simply report "Generating done".
a "Makefile" will have been created in the blowfishGDHFridge-1.0 directory.

then in that directory
type
	make
This will create the geant4 simulation which will be named simply "blowfish".

Typing "blowfish" will run the aplication and bring up the GUI
to allow inspection of the geometry.

Typing "blowfish macrofile.mac" will run the macrofile without bring up the GUI.
